What are the different types of web servers, and how do they differ in terms of functionality and performance?

Functionality: Different web servers have varying capabilities and support for protocols, modules, and programming languages. Apache and Nginx are highly versatile, supporting a wide range of functionalities and configurations. IIS is tightly integrated with Microsoft technologies, making it a preferred choice for Windows-based environments. Node.js enables developers to build full-stack applications using JavaScript throughout.

Performance: Performance can vary based on factors such as the server's architecture, resource consumption, concurrency handling, and caching mechanisms. Nginx and Lighttpd are known for their excellent performance in handling concurrent connections and static content delivery. Node.js, with its non-blocking I/O model, is well-suited for handling a large number of concurrent requests. Apache and IIS have established performance benchmarks and are optimized for different scenarios.

Node.js: Node.js is not a traditional web server but a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 engine. It allows developers to build scalable and high-performance web applications using JavaScript on the server-side. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, making it suitable for real-time applications and APIs.

Apache HTTP Server: Apache is a widely used open-source web server. It is known for its flexibility, stability, and extensive module support. Apache can handle various protocols and is compatible with different operating systems.

Nginx: Nginx is a lightweight, high-performance web server and reverse proxy server. It excels in handling concurrent connections and static content delivery. Nginx is often used for serving static files and caching, as well as load balancing.
