What is scaling, and why is it important for web applications? How does scaling differ for vertical and horizontal scaling?

Scaling, in the context of web applications, refers to the ability of an application to handle increased traffic, workload, or user demands without experiencing performance degradation or downtime. It involves adjusting the resources and infrastructure of the application to accommodate growth and ensure optimal performance.

Vertical scaling in a web application refers to increasing the resources (such as CPU, RAM, or storage) of a single server hosting the application. It involves upgrading the server hardware or configurations to handle increased traffic and workload.

Horizontal scaling in a web application involves adding more servers to the existing infrastructure to distribute the load across multiple machines. This is typically achieved by using load balancers to evenly distribute incoming requests among the servers.

In summary, vertical scaling focuses on improving the capacity of a single server, while horizontal scaling involves adding more servers to handle increased traffic and distribute the workload.
